2. Logging transactions on-chain.



from blockchain.blockchain import Blockchain
from features.nft_marketplace import NFTMarketplace

# Initialize Blockchain and NFT Marketplace
blockchain = Blockchain(num_shards=4, difficulty=3)
nft_marketplace = NFTMarketplace(blockchain)

# Example Usage
# Mint NFT
nft_marketplace.mint_nft("NFT001", "Alice", {"name": "Art Piece", "creator": "Alice"})
nft_marketplace.set_royalties("NFT001", 5.0, "Alice")

# List for Sale
nft_marketplace.list_nft_for_sale("NFT001", 100.0)

# Buy NFT
nft_marketplace.buy_nft("NFT001", "Bob", "Alice")


---

Next Steps

The NFT Marketplace Module is complete. Next, we can focus on:

1. DEX Module: Implement trading features for fungible tokens.


2. Testing: Begin testing and integration for the modularized code.

---------------------------------------

Let's proceed with modularizing the DEX Module, which will handle trading functionalities for fungible tokens. This module will provide an order book for buy and sell orders, facilitate order matching, and execute trades.


---

DEX Module

Structure

The dex.py module will include:

1. Order book management.


2. Placing buy and sell orders.


3. Matching orders.


4. Executing trades.




---

Code Implementation

dex.py

```py
from typing import List, Dict

class DecentralizedExchange:
    def __init__(self):
        # Order book: token_id -> { "buy": [...], "sell": [...] }
        self.order_book: Dict[str, Dict[str, List[Dict]]] = {}

    # Place an order
    def place_order(self, user: str, token_id: str, amount: float, price: float, is_buy: bool):
        if token_id not in self.order_book:
            self.order_book[token_id] = {"buy": [], "sell": []}

        order = {"user": user, "amount": amount, "price": price}
        if is_buy:
            self.order_book[token_id]["buy"].append(order)
            # Sort buy orders by price in descending order
            self.order_book[token_id]["buy"].sort(key=lambda x: x["price"], reverse=True)
        else:
            self.order_book[token_id]["sell"].append(order)
            # Sort sell orders by price in ascending order
            self.order_book[token_id]["sell"].sort(key=lambda x: x["price"])

    # Match buy and sell orders
    def match_orders(self, token_id: str):
        if token_id not in self.order_book:
            return

        buy_orders = self.order_book[token_id]["buy"]
        sell_orders = self.order_book[token_id]["sell"]

        while buy_orders and sell_orders and buy_orders[0]["price"] >= sell_orders[0]["price"]:
            buy_order = buy_orders[0]
            sell_order = sell_orders[0]

            # Execute trade
            trade_amount = min(buy_order["amount"], sell_order["amount"])
            trade_price = (buy_order["price"] + sell_order["price"]) / 2
            self.execute_trade(token_id, buy_order["user"], sell_order["user"], trade_amount, trade_price)

            # Update order amounts
            buy_order["amount"] -= trade_amount
            sell_order["amount"] -= trade_amount

            # Remove fully executed orders
            if buy_order["amount"] == 0:
                buy_orders.pop(0)
            if sell_order["amount"] == 0:
                sell_orders.pop(0)

    # Execute a trade
    def execute_trade(self, token_id: str, buyer: str, seller: str, amount: float, price: float):
        total_cost = amount * price
        print(f"Trade executed: {amount} {token_id} at {price} per unit.")

        # Simulate transferring funds and tokens
        # In practice, these would interact with the blockchain's ledger
        self.transfer_funds(buyer, seller, total_cost)
        self.transfer_tokens(token_id, seller, buyer, amount)

    def transfer_funds(self, buyer: str, seller: str, amount: float):
        print(f"{amount} QFC transferred from {buyer} to {seller}.")

    def transfer_tokens(self, token_id: str, seller: str, buyer: str, amount: float):
        print(f"{amount} {token_id} tokens transferred from {seller} to {buyer}.")
```

---

Features Breakdown

1. Order Placement:

Users can place buy or sell orders with specified amounts and prices.

Orders are stored in an order book, organized by token.



2. Order Matching:

Matches buy and sell orders based on price and availability.

Executes trades when the buy price is greater than or equal to the sell price.



3. Trade Execution:

Simulates fund and token transfers for each trade.

Provides a callback to integrate with the blockchain's ledger for actual transfers.





---

Example Usage

Initialize and Use the DEX

from features.dex import DecentralizedExchange

# Initialize DEX
dex = DecentralizedExchange()

# Place Orders
dex.place_order("Alice", "TOKEN1", 100, 1.5, is_buy=True)  # Alice places a buy order
dex.place_order("Bob", "TOKEN1", 50, 1.4, is_buy=False)   # Bob places a sell order
dex.place_order("Charlie", "TOKEN1", 30, 1.3, is_buy=False)  # Charlie places a sell order

# Match Orders
dex.match_orders("TOKEN1")

Expected Output

Trade executed: 50 TOKEN1 at 1.45 per unit.
150.0 QFC transferred from Alice to Bob.
50 TOKEN1 tokens transferred from Bob to Alice.

Trade executed: 30 TOKEN1 at 1.4 per unit.
42.0 QFC transferred from Alice to Charlie.
30 TOKEN1 tokens transferred from Charlie to Alice.


---

Integration with Blockchain

For real-world functionality, the DEX should integrate with the blockchain to:

1. Check Balances: Verify if the buyer/seller has sufficient funds/tokens.


2. Transfer Funds and Tokens: Update the blockchain's ledger during each trade.



Example Integration Code

def transfer_funds(self, buyer: str, seller: str, amount: float):
    if self.blockchain.get_qfc_balance(buyer) >= amount:
        self.blockchain.assets["QFC"]["balances"][buyer] -= amount
        self.blockchain.assets["QFC"]["balances"][seller] += amount
    else:
        raise ValueError("Insufficient funds.")

def transfer_tokens(self, token_id: str, seller: str, buyer: str, amount: float):
    # Implement token transfer logic
    print(f"Transferring {amount} {token_id} tokens from {seller} to {buyer}.")


---

Next Steps

With the DEX Module completed, the following tasks remain:

1. Testing and Integration: Combine the modules (Blockchain, Consensus, NFT Marketplace, DEX) and ensure they work together seamlessly.


2. Optional Extensions:

Liquidity Pools: Enable automated market making (e.g., similar to Uniswap).

User Interface: Add APIs or front-end integration for user interaction.

------------------------------------------------

Let’s add Liquidity Pools (LPs) and define APIs for the blockchain system. The Liquidity Pools module will enable automated market-making (AMM) functionality similar to Uniswap, while APIs will facilitate user interaction with blockchain features.


---

Liquidity Pools Module

Structure

The liquidity_pool.py module will:

1. Allow users to add and remove liquidity.


2. Calculate token prices based on the AMM formula: x * y = k.


3. Enable token swaps with minimal slippage.




---

Code Implementation

liquidity_pool.py

```py
from typing import Dict

class LiquidityPool:
    def __init__(self):
        # Pool balances: token -> { "reserve": ..., "liquidity_providers": { user: amount } }
        self.pools: Dict[str, Dict] = {}

    def add_liquidity(self, user: str, token_a: str, token_b: str, amount_a: float, amount_b: float):

        pool["liquidity_providers"][user] = pool["liquidity_providers"].get(user, 0) + amount_a + amount_b

        print(f"{user} added liquidity: {amount_a} {token_a}, {amount_b} {token_b}")

    def remove_liquidity(self, user: str, token_a: str, token_b: str, percentage: float):
        pool_id = self._get_pool_id(token_a, token_b)

        if pool_id not in self.pools or user not in self.pools[pool_id]["liquidity_providers"]:
            print("No liquidity to remove.")
            return

        pool = self.pools[pool_id]
        total_liquidity = pool["reserve_a"] + pool["reserve_b"]

        # Calculate amounts to remove
        amount_a = pool["reserve_a"] * percentage
        amount_b = pool["reserve_b"] * percentage

        # Update reserves and remove liquidity from the user
        pool["reserve_a"] -= amount_a
        pool["reserve_b"] -= amount_b
        pool["liquidity_providers"][user] -= total_liquidity * percentage

        print(f"{user} removed liquidity: {amount_a} {token_a}, {amount_b} {token_b}")

    def swap(self, user: str, input_token: str, output_token: str, input_amount: float):

            return

        pool = self.pools[pool_id]

        # Determine reserves
        reserve_in, reserve_out = (pool["reserve_a"], pool["reserve_b"]) if input_token < output_token else (pool["reserve_b"], pool["reserve_a"])

        # Calculate output using x * y = k
        input_amount_with_fee = input_amount * 0.997  # 0.3% fee
        output_amount = (reserve_out * input_amount_with_fee) / (reserve_in + input_amount_with_fee)

        # Update reserves
        if input_token < output_token:
            pool["reserve_a"] += input_amount
            pool["reserve_b"] -= output_amount
        else:
            pool["reserve_a"] -= output_amount
            pool["reserve_b"] += input_amount

        print(f"{user} swapped {input_amount} {input_token} for {output_amount} {output_token}")
        return output_amount

    def _get_pool_id(self, token_a: str, token_b: str) -> str:
        return f"{min(token_a, token_b)}-{max(token_a, token_b)}"
```

---

Features Breakdown

1. Add Liquidity:

Users provide equal value amounts of two tokens to create or add liquidity to a pool.

Reserves are updated, and the user's contribution is tracked.



2. Remove Liquidity:

Users can withdraw liquidity proportionally to their share of the pool.



3. Swap:

Implements the x * y = k AMM formula.

Deducts a 0.3% fee to incentivize liquidity providers.





---

API Module

Structure

The API will expose RESTful endpoints for:

1. Blockchain operations.


2. NFT management.


3. DEX trading.


4. Liquidity pool interactions.

Goal: Secure API endpoints using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.


---

Implementation: Authentication for API Endpoints

Setup Authentication

1. Use PyJWT for token generation and verification.


2. Add middleware to validate JWTs.




---

Install Dependencies

Run:

pip install pyjwt flask


---

Update API for Authentication

Token Management

File: auth.py

```py
import jwt
import datetime
from flask import request, jsonify

SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key"

# Generate a JWT for a user
def generate_token(username: str):
    payload = {
        "username": username,
        "exp": datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(hours=2),
    }
    token = jwt.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY, algorithm="HS256")
    return token

# Middleware to validate JWT
def token_required(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        token = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if not token:
            return jsonify({"message": "Token is missing!"}), 401
        try:
            jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
            return jsonify({"message": "Token has expired!"}), 401
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
            return jsonify({"message": "Invalid token!"}), 401
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```

---

Apply Authentication to API

Modify api.py to secure endpoints.

```py
from auth import generate_token, token_required

# Generate Token
@app.route('/auth/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.json
    username = data.get("username")
    if not username:
        return jsonify({"message": "Username is required"}), 400
    token = generate_token(username)
    return jsonify({"token": token})

# Secure Endpoints
@app.route('/balance/<address>', methods=['GET'])
@token_required
def get_balance(address):
    balance = blockchain.get_qfc_balance(address)
    return jsonify({"address": address, "balance": balance})

@app.route('/lp/add', methods=['POST'])
@token_required
def add_liquidity():
    data = request.json
    liquidity_pool.add_liquidity(data['user'], data['token_a'], data['token_b'], data['amount_a'], data['amount_b'])
    return jsonify({"success": True})
```

---

Example Usage

1. Login to get a token:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/login -d '{"username": "Alice"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

Response:

{"token": "eyJhbGciOi..."}


2. Use the token for authenticated requests:

curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/balance/Alice -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOi..."




---

2. Advanced Liquidity Pool Analytics

Goal: Provide analytics for liquidity pools and dynamic fee adjustments based on activity.


---

Analytics Features

1. Pool statistics:

Total reserves.

Liquidity distribution by provider.

Price impact of swaps.



2. Dynamic fee adjustment:

Higher fees during high volatility.

Lower fees during low activity.





---

Update Liquidity Pool

Modify liquidity_pool.py to add analytics.

```py
class LiquidityPool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pools = {}
        self.default_fee = 0.003  # 0.3% default fee
        self.dynamic_fee_multiplier = 1.0

    # Existing methods (add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, etc.)

    # Dynamic fee calculation
    def get_fee(self):
        return self.default_fee * self.dynamic_fee_multiplier

    # Pool statistics
    def get_pool_stats(self, token_a: str, token_b: str) -> Dict:
        pool_id = self._get_pool_id(token_a, token_b)
        if pool_id not in self.pools:
            return {"message": "Pool does not exist."}

        pool = self.pools[pool_id]
        total_liquidity = pool["reserve_a"] + pool["reserve_b"]
        return {
            "reserves": {"reserve_a": pool["reserve_a"], "reserve_b": pool["reserve_b"]},
            "total_liquidity": total_liquidity,
            "liquidity_providers": pool["liquidity_providers"],
        }

    # Adjust fee based on activity
    def adjust_fee(self, volatility: float):
        if volatility > 0.1:  # Example threshold for high volatility
            self.dynamic_fee_multiplier = min(2.0, self.dynamic_fee_multiplier + 0.1)
        else:
            self.dynamic_fee_multiplier = max(1.0, self.dynamic_fee_multiplier - 0.05)
```

---

Expose Analytics via API

Add new endpoints to api.py:

# Get Pool Stats
@app.route('/lp/stats', methods=['GET'])
@token_required
def get_pool_stats():
    token_a = request.args.get("token_a")
    token_b = request.args.get("token_b")
    stats = liquidity_pool.get_pool_stats(token_a, token_b)
    return jsonify(stats)

# Adjust Fees (Admin Endpoint)
@app.route('/lp/adjust_fee', methods=['POST'])
@token_required
def adjust_fee():
    data = request.json
    volatility = data.get("volatility")
    liquidity_pool.adjust_fee(volatility)
    return jsonify({"message": "Fee adjusted successfully."})


---

Example API Calls

1. Fetch Pool Stats:

curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:5000/lp/stats?token_a=TOKEN1&token_b=TOKEN2" -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOi..."

Response:

{
    "reserves": {"reserve_a": 1000, "reserve_b": 2000},
    "total_liquidity": 3000,
    "liquidity_providers": {"Alice": 1500, "Bob": 1500}
}


2. Adjust Fees:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/lp/adjust_fee -d '{"volatility": 0.15}' -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOi..."

Response:

{"message": "Fee adjusted successfully."}




---

Next Steps

1. Implement Testing:

Test token-based authentication.

Validate analytics and dynamic fee adjustments.



2. Deploy the System:

Host the API on cloud platforms like AWS or GCP.



3. Optional Enhancements:

Add role-based access for admin endpoints (e.g., /lp/adjust_fee).

------------------------------------------------

Let's test the authentication, liquidity pool analytics, and dynamic fee adjustment features added to the system. Below are the testing strategies and examples.


---

Testing the New Features

1. Authentication Tests

Unit Test for Token Generation and Validation

File: test_auth.py

```py
import pytest
import jwt
from auth import generate_token, token_required, SECRET_KEY

def test_generate_token():
    token = generate_token("Alice")
    assert token is not None

    # Decode the token to verify its contents
    decoded = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
    assert decoded["username"] == "Alice"

def test_token_required(client):
    @token_required
    def protected_endpoint():
        return "Access granted"

### Next Steps 

Create the QFC Onramper

-------------------------------------------------

The QFC OnRamper module is a crucial component that allows users to purchase QFC tokens using fiat currencies. This module will handle the integration with external payment processors, currency conversion, and QFC token distribution. Let's dive into the implementation of this module.

```python
from typing import Dict
import requests

class QFCOnRamper:
    def __init__(self, blockchain):
        self.blockchain = blockchain
        self.exchange_rates: Dict[str, float] = {
            "USD": 1.0,
            "EUR": 0.85,
            "JPY": 110.0,
        }

    def buy_qfc(self, user: str, amount: float, currency: str) -> bool:
        if currency not in self.exchange_rates:
            print(f"Unsupported currency: {currency}")
            return False

        qfc_amount = amount / self.exchange_rates[currency]

        if self._process_payment(user, amount, currency):
            # Add QFC to user's balance
            self.blockchain.assets["QFC"]["balances"][user] = (
                self.blockchain.get_qfc_balance(user) + qfc_amount
            )
            print(f"Successfully purchased {qfc_amount} QFC for {user}")
            return True
        else:
            print("Payment processing failed")
            return False

    def _process_payment(self, user: str, amount: float, currency: str) -> bool:
        # Simulate calling an external payment API
        try:
            # Simulating an API call
            response = requests.post(
                "https://fake-payment-processor.com/api/process",
                json={
                    "user": user,
                    "amount": amount,
                    "currency": currency
                }
            )
            return response.status_code == 200
        except requests.RequestException:
            return False
```

Here's a breakdown of the QFC OnRamper module:

1. **__init__**: The constructor initializes the blockchain instance and a dictionary of exchange rates for supported fiat currencies.

2. **buy_qfc**: This method is the main entry point for users to purchase QFC tokens. It takes the user's address, the amount to purchase, and the currency. If the currency is supported, it calculates the equivalent QFC amount based on the exchange rate and calls the `_process_payment` method to simulate the payment processing.

3. **_process_payment**: This is a private method that simulates the integration with an external payment processor. In a real-world implementation, this method would handle the actual payment processing, including verifying the user's payment information, charges, and completing the transaction.

4. **Supported Currencies**: The `exchange_rates` dictionary currently includes USD, EUR, and JPY. You can expand this list to include more fiat currencies as needed.

To test the QFC OnRamper module, you can add the following code to your main application:

```python
# Initialize the QFC OnRamper
onramp = QFCOnRamper(blockchain)

# Example usage
onramp.buy_qfc("Alice", 100, "USD")
onramp.buy_qfc("Bob", 50, "EUR")
onramp.buy_qfc("Charlie", 10000, "JPY")
```

This will simulate the purchase of QFC tokens for the users "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie" using the respective fiat currencies.



The next steps would be to:

1. **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Enhance the payment processing logic to handle various error scenarios, such as declined transactions, invalid payment information, and network failures.

2. **Integrate with Real Payment Processors**: Replace the simulated payment processing with actual integrations to popular payment gateways, such as Stripe, PayPal, or Coinbase Commerce.

3. **Implement KYC and AML Checks**: Integrate the QFC OnRamper with the existing Compliance Tools module to perform KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks on users before allowing them to purchase QFC tokens.

4. **Provide Detailed Transaction History**: Extend the QFC OnRamper to maintain a detailed transaction history, including purchase details, payment methods, and timestamps, which can be accessed by users and administrators.

5. **Implement Fiat-to-QFC Conversion Rate Monitoring**: Monitor the exchange rates of supported fiat currencies and adjust the conversion rates accordingly to ensure a smooth purchasing experience for users.

6. **Develop a User-friendly Interface**: Create a web-based or mobile interface for the QFC OnRamper, allowing users to easily navigate the purchase process, view their transaction history, and manage their QFC holdings.

By implementing these enhancements, the QFC OnRamper module will become a robust and user-friendly component that seamlessly integrates with the QuantumFuse ecosystem. This will significantly contribute to the overall adoption and usage of the QuantumFuse platform, making it an attractive investment opportunity for investors seeking exposure to a comprehensive and well-designed blockchain solution.

—------------------------------------------

2. Security for the QFC Node

Securing the QFC Node is critical to prevent attacks, safeguard data integrity, and maintain trust. Below are comprehensive measures to enhance security for the QFC Node.


---

A. Node-Level Security

1. Secure Communication

Use TLS/SSL for all API and inter-node communications.

Ensure encryption of data in transit.


Implementation:

Use Python's ssl module or a reverse proxy like Nginx with TLS.



2. Authentication

Protect APIs with JWT-based authentication.

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for admin and user endpoints.


Example:

from auth import generate_token, token_required

@app.route('/auth/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.json
    token = generate_token(data["username"])
    return jsonify({"token": token})

@app.route('/blockchain/add_transaction', methods=['POST'])
@token_required
def add_transaction():
    ...


3. Rate Limiting

Prevent brute force attacks with rate limiting on APIs.

Use libraries like Flask-Limiter for Python-based APIs.


Example:

from flask_limiter import Limiter
limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address)
@app.route('/blockchain/add_transaction', methods=['POST'])
@limiter.limit("5 per second")
def add_transaction():
    ...


4. IP Whitelisting

Allow only trusted nodes or administrators to access critical endpoints.

Use reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx) to restrict access.





---

B. Blockchain-Level Security

1. Consensus Mechanism Hardening

Integrate protection against Sybil attacks:

Require miners to stake assets or verify identity before participating.


Use a difficulty adjustment algorithm to prevent spam mining.


Example:

class GreenConsensus:
    def validate_block(self, block: Block) -> bool:
        # Ensure block adheres to consensus rules
        ...


2. Transaction Validation

Verify all incoming transactions:

Signature checks.

Prevent double spending.

Ensure sender has sufficient balance.



Example:

def verify_transaction(self, transaction: Transaction) -> bool:
    if not transaction.verify_signature(transaction.sender_public_key):
        return False
    if self.get_qfc_balance(transaction.sender) < transaction.calculate_total_cost():
        return False
    return True


3. Cross-Shard Transaction Security

Use atomicity protocols (e.g., 2-phase commit) for cross-shard transfers.





---

C. Smart Contract Security

1. Auditing

Perform thorough audits of all smart contracts (NFTs, DEX, staking) using tools like MythX, Slither, or Remix IDE.



2. Upgradable Contracts

Use proxy contracts for upgradability while keeping critical functions immutable.



3. Test Against Vulnerabilities

Protect against:

Reentrancy attacks.

Integer overflows/underflows.

Unauthorized access.



Example for Reentrancy Prevention:

function withdraw(uint _amount) external {
    uint balance = balances[msg.sender];
    require(balance >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}




---

D. Infrastructure Security

1. Node Hardening

Disable unnecessary ports and services.

Run nodes in isolated environments (e.g., Docker containers).

Next: 1. Testing

After implementing these security measures, proceed with rigorous testing to identify vulnerabilities and ensure robustness under various conditions.

--------------------------

1. Testing the QFC Node

A comprehensive testing plan ensures the reliability, scalability, and security of the QFC Node. Below is the structured approach to test each component and the system as a whole.


---

Testing Categories

A. Unit Testing

Test individual modules and their methods for correctness.

Use pytest for automated unit tests.


Example: Test Blockchain Core (blockchain.py)

import pytest
from blockchain.block import Block
from blockchain.transaction import Transaction
from blockchain.blockchain import Blockchain

@pytest.fixture
def setup_blockchain():
    return Blockchain(num_shards=4, difficulty=3)

def test_add_transaction(setup_blockchain):
    blockchain = setup_blockchain
    transaction = Transaction("Alice", "Bob", 50)
    assert blockchain.add_transaction(transaction) == True

def test_verify_transaction(setup_blockchain):
    blockchain = setup_blockchain
    transaction = Transaction("Alice", "Bob", 50)
    assert blockchain.verify_transaction(transaction) == False  # Insufficient balance


---

B. Integration Testing

Test how different modules interact, such as the DEX, NFT Marketplace, and Blockchain Core.


Example: Test DEX with Blockchain

from features.dex import DecentralizedExchange
from blockchain.blockchain import Blockchain

def test_dex_order_execution():
    blockchain = Blockchain(num_shards=2, difficulty=2)
    dex = DecentralizedExchange(blockchain)
    
    blockchain.assets["QFC"]["balances"]["Alice"] = 500
    blockchain.assets["QFC"]["balances"]["Bob"] = 0
    
    dex.place_order("Alice", "QFC", 100, 1.5, is_buy=False)  # Alice sells 100 QFC
    dex.place_order("Bob", "QFC", 50, 1.5, is_buy=True)  # Bob buys 50 QFC
    
    dex.match_orders("QFC")
    assert blockchain.get_qfc_balance("Alice") == 450
    assert blockchain.get_qfc_balance("Bob") == 50


---

C. Functional Testing

Verify that the node functions as expected from a user's perspective.

1. Transaction Submission

Test valid, invalid, and edge-case transactions.

Ensure atomicity for cross-shard transactions.



2. Mining

Simulate mining under varying network conditions.



3. Onramper

Test fiat-to-QFC conversions with different currencies and amounts.




Example:

def test_onramp_buy_qfc():
    blockchain = Blockchain(num_shards=2, difficulty=2)
    onramp = QFCOnRamper(blockchain)
    
    onramp.buy_qfc("Alice", 100, "USD")
    assert blockchain.get_qfc_balance("Alice") > 0


---

D. Security Testing

Test vulnerabilities and ensure the robustness of the node.

1. Penetration Testing

Use tools like OWASP ZAP to simulate attacks on APIs.

Identify injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypass, or rate-limiting issues.



2. Smart Contract Testing

Use MythX, Slither, and Echidna to test for:

Reentrancy.

Integer overflows/underflows.

Unauthorized access.




3. Stress Testing

Simulate DDoS attacks using Locust or Apache JMeter.

Monitor how the node handles high traffic or transaction loads.




Example Locust Script:

from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class QFCNodeUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 2)

    @task
    def submit_transaction(self):
        self.client.post("/blockchain/add_transaction", json={
            "sender": "Alice",
            "recipient": "Bob",
            "amount": 10,
        })


---

E. Performance Testing

Measure the node's throughput and latency under load.

Tools: k6, Locust, or JMeter.


Metrics:

1. Transactions Per Second (TPS).


2. Block Mining Time.


3. Shard Scalability.



Example Using k6:

import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
    let url = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/blockchain/add_transaction';
    let payload = JSON.stringify({ sender: "Alice", recipient: "Bob", amount: 50 });
    let params = { headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } };
    http.post(url, payload, params);
}


---

F. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Test the system with end-users to validate real-world scenarios.

Create test cases for:

1. Submitting a transaction.


2. Buying QFC via the Onramper.


3. Using the DEX to swap tokens.


4. Minting and trading NFTs.





---

G. Regression Testing

Run all tests after any code changes to ensure existing functionalities are intact.

Automate with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.


Example GitHub Actions Workflow:

name: Test QFC Node
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run Tests
        run: pytest

    }

    async submitTransaction(sender: string, recipient: string, amount: number) {
        const payload = { sender, recipient, amount };
        const response = await axios.post(`${this.nodeUrl}/blockchain/add_transaction`, payload);
        return response.data;
    }
}

// Example Usage
const sdk = new QFCNodeSDK("http://127.0.0.1:5000");
sdk.getBalance("Alice").then(console.log);
sdk.submitTransaction("Alice", "Bob", 50);
